# $PIXOTCHI Creator Coin Launch Blueprint

## Disclaimer

This document outlines the current blueprint for our $PIXOTCHI Creator Coin launch. These plans are not finalized and may change at any time if we determine it necessary. Some aspects are beyond our control. We are sharing this internally to gather additional feedback.

## Pixotchi in a Nutshell

Pixotchi is an onchain Tamagotchi-style game where your NFT starts as a pot and grows into a plant through care and attention. Players water, fertilize, and nurture their plants to earn points, which directly translate to Ethereum rewards from a 2% trading volume pool. The game includes a broader ecosystem with lands, staking, arcade mini-games, quests, competitive leaderboards, and strategic gameplay mechanics. Players can stake SEED tokens to earn LEAF (a non-tradable ERC-20 token) used to upgrade land buildings and unlock production capabilities—all built around the core loop of nurturing your plant over time and earning rewards for your effort and consistency over time.

## Purpose of This Launch

Pixotchi is a product. While creator coins were originally designed for influencers, we believe we can adapt to this trend by thinking outside the box. We can utilize the creator coin alongside our current economy, leverage its mechanics, and write our own narrative for the first time.

### Our Goals

- Increase engagement and exposure
- Strengthen SEED and game economy
- Add utility without causing inflation
- Create a new revenue stream for maintaining development costs and enabling buybacks
- Adapt to emerging market trends while introducing our own unique narrative

### Why we should:

Along for the various utility and purposes for the new token listed further below this document, it's key to note our current limitations and bottlenecks in reaching more users at this stage of market:

- BaseSwap LP, Access to our LP is very limited and we are potentially missing on a lot of traders who only use Uniswap and other well-known dexs which do not support BaseSwap LP.
- SEED launch had no team allocation; this tied our hand when it comes to funding certain type of rewards to player and giving liquid assets as a way to incenvetize players and increase conversation rate. With Creator Coin tokenomics, we can overcome this.
- Current Base's focus is on Creator Coins. From Base app accessibility to social promotion, all signals that P2E Gaming season or attention may not be happening soon. Pixotchi is at a critical point and adapting to what is happening is important. We don't wanna be Nokia.

## Tokenomics Overview (Per ZORA Documentation)

### Total Supply

1,000,000,000 $PIXOTCHI (fixed supply)

### Distribution

- **50%** Publicly tradable immediately
- **50%** Reserved for Pixotchi (creator), vested linearly over 5 years

### Revenue Stream

1% of all $PIXOTCHI trading fees on Zora are paid directly to Pixotchi in $ZORA tokens, starting from the first trade at launch.

## Launch Plan

Public announcements will be made to inform followers that the token launch is upcoming. The exact launch time will only be announced to players in-game as a measure to prevent sniping. After launch, the token will be added to Poet's Public Cabal group, increasing visibility and revenue sharing for the members of the cabal, further sparking interest.

This approach will also help revitalize the current stale economy by generating hype, as new players will join in anticipation of the airdrop. It is critical to achieve high conversion and retention rates from these new users.

---

## Airdrop Roadmap

### Initial Airdrop

There will be an initial airdrop to current players (0.2% of the 1% initial allocation). The criteria will be determined internally and not announced publicly to avoid inorganic farming behavior.

### Ongoing Airdrops

The remaining vested 500M supply creates a predictable and controlled distribution pool that we can leverage to reward players with airdrops at set intervals (e.g., 1-2M $PIXOTCHI tokens per quarter or month, based on various factors).

## What Will Drive Demand for $PIXOTCHI Token

$PIXOTCHI is powered by social activity, while SEED is powered by gameplay. The two must reinforce each other, not compete.

The creator coin allows us to unlock certain features, such as:

- **Themes** – Cosmetic customization options
- **In-game functions** – Advanced dashboards, bulk transactions for time-consuming tasks (e.g., collecting from warehouses across all buildings in one transaction), which will require players to hold a certain amount of the token
- **Governance token** – Voting on project direction once we exceed 100 active players (through snapshot platform)
- **New elements/buildings/levels** – Exclusive content that can only be used or upgraded with $PIXOTCHI tokens, which are then burned, making $PIXOTCHI deflationary and balancing the vested release schedule

---

## Why Demand for $PIXOTCHI Token Matters

Strong demand for $PIXOTCHI enables us to execute buybacks of SEED tokens, adding to our treasury and rewards funds. It will make the game more dynamic by introducing a new type of liquid asset reward in quests, arcade games, and other features. We can also explore the possibility of adding $PIXOTCHI as a reward for staking SEED (currently, staking SEED only generates LEAF tokens).

**Important:** SEED token buybacks will ONLY be funded from Zora fee revenues and NOT from the creator allocation, to avoid inflationary pressure.

## The $PIXOTCHI × $SEED × $LEAF Trio

Pixotchi is a comprehensive gaming ecosystem with multiple smart contracts and various complex features and gameplay flows. This complexity allows us to engineer utility for a new token within our game—one that has liquidity and an LP (unlike LEAF).

This approach positions us to become one of the first onchain games to integrate creator coins as a meaningful system with long-term utility, not just a passing trend. Being open source, also means no matter the circumstances, the tokens utility could be maintained to an extent incase of Pixotchi shutting down for any unplanned reason (God forbid lol)

---

By thoughtfully integrating $PIXOTCHI into our existing economy, we aim to create a sustainable, multi-token ecosystem that rewards players, drives engagement, and provides ongoing funding for development—all while maintaining economic balance across SEED, LEAF, and PIXOTCHI tokens, while redefining a new narrative for Creator Coins. (Ecosystem Coins maybe?)
